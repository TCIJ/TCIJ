The CIJ is an experimental laboratory that teaches reporters new tools alongside the traditional craft of investigative journalism. 
We incubate promising new investigative projects and open out investigative journalism into fertile new territory.

Established in 2003 by the late investigative journalist and filmmaker Gavin MacFadyen and others as a response to the worrying decline of investigative reporting, 
our remit is like no other – we can take more risks than a conventional public interest publisher, be more radical than an advocacy NGO and be more innovative than either 
in championing new ways to do investigative journalism in the public interest.

By robustly defending investigative journalists and all those who work with them, we’ve earned a reputation for integrity that is second-to-none.

We run training courses, conferences and events in a wide range of investigative skills, including data journalism and newsroom coding.
